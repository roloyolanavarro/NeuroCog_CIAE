#Digit Span Task 10/06/2022 RLoyola based on Pavlovia DigitSpan task
-----------------

The experiment:

	In this task participants are required to memorise and recall number series in backwardorder. Participants start out with two 3-digit sequences, and ends when particpants makes two consecutive series completletly wrong. Each sequence length is presented two times; maximum sequence length is 10 digits. 
	There are 4 conditions: two automatically triggered sequences, and two self-initiated sequences. Each sequence starts with a central dot plus tone (0.5 s), continues with a central fixation cross (random or fixed time presentation) and then presents the digit sequences. Each digit lasts for 1 sec. 


Analysing your data:
