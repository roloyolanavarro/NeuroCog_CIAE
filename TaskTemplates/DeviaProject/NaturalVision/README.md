Natural vision experiment. A series of images are presented one after the other for a certain amount of time.
The original experiment tracks the saccades and use them to set the image duration. 
I commented all the lines related to eyetracking, so images are last just few miliseconds (are presented as a flash)

To run the experiment with no eyetracking system linked, use *free_visual_exp_NOTRACKER.py* otherwise, use free_visual_exp_final
