#Free_visual_prediction is a Natural viewing experiment which presents series of images
#The original experiment is designed to track the saccades, which triggers the timelapse the image will last. 
#I commented all the lines related to eyetracking, so images are presented as a flash, lasting few miliseconds. 
#The experiment runs with free_visual_exp_NOTRACKER.py when not linked to eyetracking system
#Still working on it
